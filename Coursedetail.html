<dt><B>1.Python </B></dt>
<dd> Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows<br> 
developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs<br>  
on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that 
prototyping can be very quick.<br></dd> 
<dt><B>2.Cyber Security</B></dt>
<dd> Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems,<br>
 networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic<br>
 information security.<br></dd>
<dt><B>3.C programming</B></dt>
<dd> C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.<br>
It is a very popular language, despite being old.C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the <br>
UNIX operating system.<br></dd>
<dt> <b>4.Core Java</b></dt>
<dd> Learn the basic syntax and functions of the Java programming language. Apply object-oriented programming <br>
techniques to building classes, creating objects, and understanding how solutions are packaged in Java. Learn how <br>
to implement inheritance and polymorphism in Java.<br></dd>

<dt><b>1.Data Science</b></dt>
<dd>Data science is the field of applying advanced analytics techniques and scientific principles to extract valuable <br>
information from data for business decision-making, strategic planning and other uses.<br>
</dd>
<dt><b> 2.Machine Learning</b></dt>
<dd>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to “self-learn” from  <br> 
training data and improve over time, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms are able to  <br>
detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to make their own predictions. <br>
