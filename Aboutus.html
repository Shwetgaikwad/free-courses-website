<h1> About Codecademy</h1></center>
<b>Our History</b><br>
<big>When we started Codecademy, our goal was to give anyone in the world <br>
the ability to learn the skills they’d need to succeed in the 21st century.<br>
We set out to create a new, interactive way of learning - making it <br>
engaging, flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. <br>
Since then, we have helped millions of people worldwide unlock <br>
modern technical skills and reach their full potential through code. <br>

<b>Our Mission</b><br>
<big>We want to create a world where anyone can build something  <br>
meaningful with technology, and everyone has the learning tools,  <br>
resources, and opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of  <br>
possibilities - all that’s required is the curiosity and drive to learn. At <br> 
Codecademy, we are committed to empowering all people, regardless <br>
 of where they are in their coding journeys, to continue to learn, grow, <br>
 and make an impact on the world around them. <br>
